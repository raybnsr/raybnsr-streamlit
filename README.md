# Accident Severity Prediction App

## Description
This is a multiclass classification project to classify the severity of road accidents into three categories. This project is based on real-world data, and the dataset is also highly imbalanced. There are three types of injuries: minor, severe, and fatal.

Road accidents are the major cause of unnatural deaths around the world. To reduce accidents and fatalities, all governments work hard to raise awareness about the rules and regulations that must be followed when driving a vehicle on the road.

This application was created in collaboration with Avikumar Talaviya - a Mumbai chapter lead at OmdenaAI (StackUp Community)

## Usage
Predict the severity of road accidents to take necessary precautions by the investigation agency.

## Tools
- Apply EDA techniques to get insights of a dataset
- Perform feature engineering and feature selection techniques
- Treat an imbalanced dataset using the SMOTENC technique
- Build, evaluate and export a random forest classification model
- Build and deploy a Streamlit web application
